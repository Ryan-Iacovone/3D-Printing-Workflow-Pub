# Workflow for Recieving, Handling, and Contacting Patron's 3D Print Requests 
 
## Overview 

The 3D printing program used to rely soley on pen and paper for taking in and processing 3D print requests. Once a print request was completed, staff would have to manually contact the patron by phone or email (whichever one was more legible). This was an arduous process that ate up a ton of staff hours that could have been devoted to tasks actually in the job description of a librarian. These paper slips would commonly get lost leading to awkward interactions when a patron came to check on their print request but staff could not find any evidence of it. A typical problem when using pen and paper to recieve 3D print requests was that staff had no way to control the types of prints patrons would request. This lead to many patron requests that simply did not fit the parameters of our 3D printers or were unable to be found on open source repositiroies. In addition, staff had no way to compile useful information on how well the program was performing like most popular requests or colors or simply the turnaround time from recieving a 3D print request to contacting the patron that it was finished.

To fix those issues, I worked to devise a new 3D printing workflow that would leverage an online form and automation to streamline the 3D printing process for both staff and patrons. For the first step, I created an online form that would ask basic contact information and the patrons library card number (in order to better enforce our 1 3D print per month policy). The form gave patrons the option of colored filament to use for the 20 handpicked 3D print rquests tested by staff that we knew worked well with our printers and could be scaled by printing multiple at a time. If a patron wanted something not included in our curated list a link was provided to an online 3D printing respository. Responses from the form were then automatically fed into a shared excel spreadsheet were I built 3 python programs to organize all the data to be easily acted upon by staff. 

No knowledge of coding or the command prompt is requered to utilize each of these programs! Once downloaded as an executable to your PC each program walks/infomrs staff through the process with simple y/n (yes/no) prompts. The programs show staff previews of excel sheets and email lists to verify and proceed if desired. These programs are also designed to ask staff if they wish to delete old versions of excel sheets made by these programs to ensure no valuable data is lost.     

## Emailing Sheet 

The "email sheet" program filters prints from the master excel sheet that have not yet been completed into a new excel sheet to be printed off. To make the process for printing 3D print requests more efficient, I organzied the list of 3D prints to be completed pimrarily by color then by date. This way we can start multiple same colored prints on the printer at once to save time from constatnly switching out the filament color. The program then emails that excel sheet (3D print jobs for week of {today}.xlsx) out to 3D print staff with instructions to appropriatly format it to be printed off. With our new printed out list of 3D print requests we have to go into the master excel doc to update it that these specific prints have been printed on the sheet. The program spits out two files the second one (Updated sheet_print {today}.xlsx) that we will use to update the column on the master called "sheet_print" so that these specific prints are not printed out again

## Emailing Patrons 

Once print requests are marked off as as completed using the "print_completed" column in the master excel sheet we can use the "email patrons" program to find all the print requests who have not yet been contacted and send them a personal automated email informing the specific patron that their specific request is ready to be picked up. The program uses a regular expression to look at all the provided email addresses to ensure they follow a proper email format marking all invalided emails in the "invalid_email" column reducing the risk of bounced emails. Once all the emails have been sent out to patrons the program creates and saves an new excel sheet to the desktop titled "Patron_Contacted_Updated {today}.xlsx" that appriately marks each of the print requests as contacted and fills in the date the emails were sent. Staff then uses that new excel sheet to copy paste the columns "patron_contacted",	"contacted_date",	"recontacted?", and	"invalid_email" into the master excel sheet. 

## Expired Prints 

Some patrons will inevitably never come to pick up their 3D print request. To make cleaning out old 3D print requests as seamless as possible staff can run "expired prints" program to create a sheet that will list all the prints that were completed at least 3 weeks ago but never picked up. Using that newly created sheet staff can esily pick through the expired 3D print requests and put them in the donation pile for other patrons to have. Like with The "email sheet" program, staff have the option to email the newly created excel sheet called "Expired 3D prints week of {today}.xlsx" to the 3D print team for someone else to print off and merely have this be an automatically generated process/email every week or 2 weeks depending on print volume. Finally with the expried 3D prints taken out of storage we can need to go through an update the "print_expired" column in the master excel sheet so that they do not appear in next weeks expired prints report. Also so that if a patron comes in asking about a 3D print request that expried, staff will have easy access to that imformation to tell them they didn't come pick it up in time. 

# Fruther Investigation 

Ad hoc analysis into the performance of the 3D printing programing is done in a separate repository called "3D-prints-analysis-PUB".
